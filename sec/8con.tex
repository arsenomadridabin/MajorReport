\section{CONCLUSION}
%\subsection{Conclusion}
In this project, Stock Price of individual companies and sectors  were predicted for the context of Nepal. Numeric data were collected from NEPSE website, Merolagani website and Sharesansar website. The price for the following day were successfully predicted with considerable accuracy.Alongside this,the strength of each companies were measured with the help of fundamental analysis. 
Web application has been developed in which user can see different data visualization and the predicted stock price. 

% \subsection{Limitations}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The system does not cover live data update feature.
% \item The system is designed to work for only selected companies.
% \item Only technical analysis is considered for prediction.
% \item Not enough data to train.
% \item For prediction, only two models: Weighted Moving Average and Artificial Neural Network using Backpropagation were considered. 
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Further Enhancement}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Live data update feature can be implemented for better visualization.
% \item Provided the data are available, the system can be designed to work for all companies listed in NEPSE.
% \item Both Technical and Financial Analysis need to be considered for better result. 
% \item The system is to be trained with healthy amount of data for better result . 
% \item  Along with ANN and statistical techniques, news and twitter sentiment analysis could also be considered for better result. 
% %\item Different models for different sector need to be considered . 
% \end{itemize}
