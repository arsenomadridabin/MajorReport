\textbf{Agile Software Development Model}\\
Agile methodology is an alternative to traditional project management, typically used in software development. It helps teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints. Agile methodologies are an alternative to waterfall, or traditional sequential development.Agile development model is a type of Incremental model. Software is developed in incremental, rapid cycles. This results in small incremental releases with each release building on
previous functionality. Each release is thoroughly tested to ensure software quality is maintained. Agile model is generally used for time critical applications. The project is started by preparing the backlog. The backlog contains the modular decomposition of the overall system. Then the requirement specification and system model diagrams are prepared. Agile
is an adaptive model which allows continuous changes in the system requirements as well the system model.
